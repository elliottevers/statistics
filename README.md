These are problem sets from the book "All of Statistics" by Larry Wasserman, labs from the "Statistics in R" course on Coursera, and all associated notes.  Since I completed it, it looks like 1) it takes the Jupyter and R notebooks a long time to render and 2) some of the LaTeX is typesetting in a *very* wonky fashion - this needs to be curated imminently.
